		<h3 class="hcenter">Absence</h3>
		
		<p>When a student is absent from school, he/she must have written documentation stating the reason for the absence.  If a parent calls, write info. on a phone 				conference form.  If a note is written in the planner, have the front office make a copy.  Teachers are responsible for keeping documentation. A student will be 			excused from school, <strong>only</strong> for the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Illness (However, excessive illness of 10 or more days requires medical documentation)</li>
			<li>Observance of a religious holiday</li>
			<li>Law enforcement order or court subpoena</li>
			<li>Death of a family member</li>
			<li>Natural disaster</li>
			<li>Traffic accident that directly involved the student</li>
			<li>Extraordinary circumstances or situations, pre-arranged with Principal's permission</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It is imperative that the teachers check, verify, and make changes as needed to all attendance summary sheets submitted to the front office.  These are legal 			documents and must be accurate for appropriate action and state audit.</p>
		
		<p>Absences due to <strong>head lice</strong> in excess of 3 school days will be considered <strong>unexcused</strong> absences.  If a student misses more than 3 days 		due to head lice, the teacher will notify guidance and a nurse referral will be submitted.</p>
		
		<p>If an excuse note is not received by teacher and reported to front office, after 5 days -OR- if the reason does not meet excused absence criteria, the absence will 		remain <strong>unexcused</strong>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>All unexcused absences will result in grades of 0's for missed work.</strong></P>
		
		<p>If a child is absent for 10 or more days due to illness or other excused absence the Guidance Counselor will send a letter home to the parents outlining the 			attendance policy.  After 15 or more excused absences a nurse referral will be submitted. </p>
		
		<p>After 15 or more excused absences and with Principal authorization, a letter will be sent home requiring medical documentation for all subsequent absences.  If 			medical documentation is not submitted for subsequent absences then they will be marked unexcused.</p>
		
		<h3 class="hcenter">Tardy</h3>
		
		<p>Students should be in the classroom by 7:50 a.m. All students that arrive after 7:50 a.m. need to be checked in through the front office by their parent. </p>
		
		<p>Before 8:00 a.m., students will report to the classroom if late for school and the teacher will write a tardy slip.  One copy of the tardy slip should be stapled 		in the child's planner and the second copy is for teacher records.  This data should be saved and utilized to document children with excessive tardies </p>
		
		<p>After 8:00 a.m. all students who are tardy will be sent to the front office and the front office staff will document the late arrival and notify the teacher.  The 		teacher will write a tardy slip, staple one copy to the planner and keep the other copy for their records.</p>

		<p>A student who accumulates five and one half (5 Â½ hours or 330 minutes) of absence due to tardiness during the regular school day, without documented reason for 			<strong>unexcused</strong>, shall be deemed absent for one school day.  The student will receive 0's for all work for one school day .</p>
