		<h2>&ldquo;Commitment to Excellence&rdquo;</h2>
		
		<p>Spring   Lake Elementary is uniquely composed of over 700 students representing 36 countries.  We are proud of the richness and distinctness of our community's 		many cultures and demographics! Our lives are so much richer and fuller when we appreciate and value other people, even those who are very different from us 			in culture or race.  

		<p>Spring Lake Elementary will continue to explore methods of revitalizing classroom instruction utilizing emerging technology and research. We have worked to build 		our technological resources while keeping in mind our ultimate goal to add technology to make classroom instruction more engaging to students. Some of our most 		engaging technology consists of class sets of palms, response clickers, laptop computers, and flip cameras for student presentations, just to name a few.</p>

		<p>We are so excited to be in our newly remodeled building! Our main building underwent a major renovation during the 2009-2010 school year and we very pleased with 		the results. Building 1 now houses 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grades as well as a new media center, news studio, computer production lab, and our “manatee area” which 			consists of a new stage with a state of the art lighting and sound system for school performances. The new classrooms are all self contained and equipped with 			Bright Link projectors, interactive white boards, and Light Speed microphone sound systems to enhance instruction. We haven’t forgotten about our buildings 2 and 		3 throughout the renovation. They have all been updated as well with interactive boards to enhance instruction.  Walking the hallways in the mornings is a calming 		experience with classical music playing softly while students await another exciting day at Spring Lake Elementary to begin.</p>  

		<p>Spring Lake Elementary has adopted a new behavior incentive program called PBS. PBS stands for “Positive Behavior Support” and is a program for setting 				expectations and aligning those expectations with positive reinforcement to encourage positive behavior. The four expectations that all students will be learning 		about at Spring Lake are Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Honest, and Be an Active Participant. Teachers will continuously model and teach what each of these 				expectations looks like within our school and students and classes will be recognized for following our expectations regularly. Our students will continue to 			practice Cooperative Learning strategies within the classroom to promote positive student interaction, enhance communication skills, and create a respectful 			climate that will encourage them to monitor their own behavior.</p>
